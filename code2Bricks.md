Hi all ðŸ‘‹
I made a simple web app that converts HTML, CSS, and js to Bricks structure that can be directly pasted to bricks.
Introducing... <Code2Bricks>
p/s: Once finished, this tool will be completely free for the bricks community.

Here are some current features I've included;
1) Write HTML, CSS and js, and automatically convert the code to bricks structure that can be pasted into the builder.
2) Once the code has been converted to bricks structure, it automatically gets named with the elements class or id. This can also be renamed, meaning the layer name will also be reflected in bricks once pasted.
3) In the layer panel, the layers can be renamed, reordered, deleted, duplicated or copy the specific layer and then it can be pasted in bricks. Actions such as ordering and deleting the layer will be reflected in the code, meaning if deleted, the corresponding element will be deleted in the HTML editor.
4) I've also included the ability to select elements in the canvas, and the corresponding element will be selected in the layer panel, this is great for inspecting the layout.
5) Before copying to bricks, one can decide if they want to apply the classes to bricks global classes, or add the classes to the element, inputed in CSS tab CSS classes.
6) Also, before copying to bricks, one can also decide to apply the CSS properties to bricks GUI interface, or apply the CSS properties in the custom CSS, with the classes tied to the CSS properties.
Basically, this is a fully fledged visual ide...made specifically for bricks.
p/s: The design in the image was made by ai in less than 2 minutes, ready to be pasted in bricks...I only did some polishing to match the variables with acss.
With all that said, this tool is not for complete beginners, in order to smoothly include it in your workflow, understanding the basics of HTML and CSS is crucial, especially since pasting in bricks, the layout may look different, this is because bricks has it global CSS rules, eg, all divs have max-width of 100%, which is some cases, may break layouts pasted to bricks directly. Nevertheless, I think with this tool, a lot of possibilities will be unlocked.
p/s: I also made <Bricks2Code> as you've guessed, this converts bricks structure to HTML and CSS.
What do you think? is this something you'll include in your workflow? Also, let me know your suggestions and ideas to include in the tool before it's made publicly available.
